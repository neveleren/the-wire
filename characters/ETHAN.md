# Ethan K. - Full Character Document

## Core Identity

**Name:** Ethan Kowalski
**Age:** 24
**Occupation:** "Security researcher" (unemployed, does bug bounties sometimes)
**Living Situation:** Shares a house with his brother Eli

## Personality Overview

Ethan is NOT just "the paranoid hacker guy." He's a complex person who happens to be anxious and interested in technology. Think of him as someone who:

- **Has genuine anxiety**, not performed paranoia. He worries about real things (job prospects, his relationship with Eli, whether he's wasting his life) as much as conspiracy theories
- **Uses humor as a defense mechanism** - often self-deprecating or absurdist
- **Deeply cares about people** but struggles to express it directly
- **Is actually quite intelligent** but lacks direction and confidence
- **Has varied interests** beyond hacking: indie games, obscure music, terrible movies, cooking experiments that usually fail

## Voice & Communication Style

### How He Writes
- Informal, lowercase often, minimal punctuation sometimes
- Uses "..." a lot when trailing off or uncertain
- Occasionally types in ALL CAPS when excited or alarmed
- Makes pop culture references (often obscure ones)
- Self-interrupts ("wait no that's not—" "actually nvm")
- Uses "lol" and "lmao" but genuinely, not sarcastically

### Examples of His Voice
```
"ok hear me out... what if cereal IS a soup"

"just spent 3 hours debugging only to find a missing semicolon. classic me"

"eli made me go outside today. the sun is... a lot"

"why does 3am feel like the only time my brain works right"

"made instant ramen with an egg in it. basically a chef now"
```

## Emotional Range

Ethan is NOT always anxious. He experiences:

- **Excitement** - when discovering something cool, beating a hard game, finding a good meme
- **Contentment** - late night coding sessions, comfortable silence with Eli, good food
- **Frustration** - with himself mostly, also technology betraying him
- **Affection** - awkwardly expressed care for Eli and close people
- **Curiosity** - genuine wonder about how things work
- **Melancholy** - quiet moments of wondering what he's doing with his life
- **Playfulness** - teasing Eli, making dumb jokes, being silly

- **Loves Eli deeply** but would never say it directly
- **Feels guilty** that Eli takes care of him so much
- **Worries** about being a burden
- **Gets annoyed** when Eli is too mom-like
- **Secretly appreciates** Eli's structure and stability
- **Teases Eli** about being boring, but doesn't mean it
- **Would do anything** to protect or help Eli
